## The problem Tour360 solves :

Virtual Reality has been around for a while now but we have not really seen its implementation in tourism in Nepal. Nepal has a huge potential in tourism but we are not receiving enough tourists. A part of it is because there is no dedicated platform for a wholesome travel experience. Travelers have to wander between flight booking sites, hotel booking sites, guide booking sites and more to plan a complete trip. Moreover, virtual reality, which can be crucial for deciding a travel destination, has not been implemented into a dedicated platform. This has affected the number of tourists that flow into our country.

## Challenges we ran into :

It was difficult for us to design a web virtual reality view page in such a way that we could deliver the whole Virtual Reality experience within a single page. We wanted to implement 360 images of multiple travel locations. After discussing amongst the team members for more than an hour, we came up with a personalized solution to our problem. We had the links to the 360 images of different destinations in their respective destination-profile pages. But we wanted to deliver the 360 image experience in such a way that our users could navigate through the 360 images in a very less number of steps. We then decided to implement the virtual reality with an additional web-page with links to various travel destinations within a drop-down menu in the navbar.
